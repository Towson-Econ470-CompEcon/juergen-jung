Open a terminal in your local repository 
                folder: `econ-firstname-lastname` 

Then type the following: 
```
$ git pull 
```
This will fetch and merge the latest GitHub repository content 

Now open the `.py` files or create new ones and write your 
                code. When you are finished it's time to `stage` and `commit` 
                the changes. To do this type the following in your terminal 
                window. Make sure you got all the dashes correct! 
```
$ git status 
$ git add --all 
$ git commit -m 'some commit message' 
$ git push 
```
Give it a minute, then got to GitHub with your browser and 
                  make sure all your files have been uploaded.
